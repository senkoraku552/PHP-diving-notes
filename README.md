### php was my first Web-backend language, 
\n
it has been let me self-learn from basic scrach to current advance php.

Now I've been able to performance full OOP way in php, and since after php-8.0 it has been getting huge improve.

Hopeful there would be more people learn to program phps and let php become more powerfule language.
